      <p>
        The guitar is a stringed musical instrument that is usually fretted
        (with some exceptions) and typically has six or twelve strings. It is
        usually held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or
        plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously
        pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite
        hand. A guitar pick may also be used to strike the strings. The sound of
        the guitar is projected either acoustically, by means of a resonant
        hollow chamber on the guitar, or amplified by an electronic pickup and
        an amplifier.
